# Motivation

Rockbursts, which are violent, dynamic failures in high stress underground mines,
pose a significant threat to miners and operations. Much like earthquakes, these
events can release significant amounts of energy nearly instantaneously, and are
notoriously difficult to predict.

For hardrock mines, however, seismic monitoring has proven invaluable for understanding
and managing rockburst risks. Very few deep underground hardrock mines operate without
seismic monitoring.

Longwall coal mines, however, have struggled to apply seismic monitoring for a few
reasons [@swanson2016seismic] including:

- Coal mines operate at much larger scales and mine more quickly than most hardrock mines
- Use of electronics is heavily restricted due to the potential for explosive atmospheres
- Coal mines tend to produce many more events per unit time than hardrock mines

The help overcome these challenges, we developed a new approach to
monitor bursts occurring near the longwall face. The monitoring array is physically
attached to the mining equipment, so it requires minimal re-configuration as mining advances.
In addition to recording seismic (elastic) vibrations traveling through the rock and equipment,
the array also records fluctuations of air-pressure (sounds) near the damage sites.
And the best part; the electronics can bed deployed kilometers away from the
monitoring site, the array itself is simply composed of standard fiber-optic cables.

# Longwall Mining

Longwall mining is the most productive form of underground coal mining. It is also
employed for mining other minerals like soda ash (e.g., in the form of trona) and
pot ash. 

On a high level, a longwall consists of long line of hydraulic shields, a cutting device,
and a conveyor system which hauls the coal out of the mine.

# Array Development and Deployment

The core technology of the new monitoring approach is a type of distributed fiber optic sensing (DFOS)
known as distributed acoustic sensing (DAS). DAS uses low-power, rapid laser pulses to measure subtle
strains in standard fiber-optic cable. DAS has been used extensively in the oil and gas industry, and
for other geophysical purposes [@lindsey2021fiber] but is only starting to find applications in mining.

Our array consists of lead-cables, which are attached to the shields of the
longwall, and microphones, or "acoustic transducers", which are just fiber optic
cable wrapped around thin-walled plastic cylinders.

We deployed the array on the longwall of an underground mine in the United States.
The lead cables (red) were zip-tied to the shields and 14 microphones were deployed
across the face.

# Data

During the deployment, several seismic events were detected by a surface seismic network.

Here are a few examples of the audio recorded by the DAS microphones during these events:

Examining the recorded waveforms, distinct characteristics of lead cables, which again, are attached
to the longwall shields, and the acoustic streams recorded by the microphones are apparent:

The lead cables (blue) tend to record more impulsive, shorter duration signals across the entire
array whereas the microphones record emergent, long duration signals on a few channels
close to the event damage.

# Monitoring Implications

The array overcomes many of the shortcomings of traditional in-mine seismic monitoring for
coal mines: sensors seldom need to be moved, and no permissible fiber-optic cable is used
for the sensing elements.

Additionally, the array records near-field data (sounds and vibrations) of bursting damage.
These types of recordings may provide information about the extent and mechanisms of the damage,
energy involved, and gas liberation than far-field seismic sensors alone.

However, additional advancements are needed before this type of monitoring can be routinely
conducted in longwall mines. First, the longwall environment is extremely punishing so
careful consideration must be given to fastening locations and rugged cable is needed
for long-term monitoring. Second, the longwall face is extremely noisy with cutting, moving
equipment, etc. so deliberate filtering and noise suppression is needed to improve array
sensitivity.

# Conclusions

Distributed fiber optic sensing may play an important part for stability monitoring
in underground mines in the future. Here we have demonstrated a monitoring
strategy for longwall mines.
