# Introduction

[Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/) is an immensely popular data modeling, parsing, validation,
library. It powers other popular libraries like [fastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/), and
its founding team [recently started a VC-funded company](https://pydantic.dev/announcement/). 

Pydantic is useful for many types of developers, not just professional 
python programmers. Although pydantic includes detailed and exhaustive documentation,
it can be pretty daunting for development-adjacent practitioners, such as
(data) scientists. The purpose of this series of posts is to provide a gentle 
introduction to pydantic  with a focus on its use in the context of scientific programing
and data modeling.

So, to the humble scientist, why should you use Pydantic? Well it provides the following
features:

1. Simple data modeling

2. Validation that gets out of your way

3. Automatic serialization

However, employing pydantic takes a bit of skill to not wind up with a confusing, inefficient,
object-oriented mess, so let's dive into it.  

# Simple Data Modeling




Pydantic is a powerful and intuitive Python library that can be incredibly useful for scientists
working with complex data models. It is particularly useful for creating and validating data models
for scientific simulations, machine learning models, and other scientific applications that require
a high level of accuracy and reliability.

Pydantic provides a simple way to define data models and validate input data against those models.
It is designed to be fast and efficient, making it ideal for handling large datasets. Additionally,
it provides built-in serialization and deserialization capabilities, which make it easy to convert
data models to and from JSON, YAML, and other data formats.

One of the main benefits of using Pydantic is that it allows scientists to define data models in a
clear and concise manner, making it easier to communicate their data requirements to other members
of their team. This can be especially useful in collaborative research projects where multiple
people are working with the same data.

Pydantic's validation capabilities are another key feature for scientists. It can validate data
inputs based on a variety of criteria, including type, range, and format. This makes it easy to
catch errors and inconsistencies in data inputs, which can be critical in scientific research
where accuracy is paramount.

Furthermore, Pydantic allows scientists to define default values for their data models, 
making it easier to handle missing or incomplete data. This can be particularly useful when
working with large datasets where missing values can be common.

Overall, Pydantic is an excellent library for scientists who need to work with complex data models.
Its powerful validation and serialization capabilities, combined with its ability to define clear
and concise data models, make it a valuable tool for any scientific application that requires
high-quality data handling and processing.
